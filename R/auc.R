#' Area under the ROC Curve
#'
#' Get the Area under the ROC curve to assess classifier performance using `pROC`
#'
#' Consider looking at Balanced Accuracy and F1 as well
#'
#' Important Note: We always assume that true labels are a factor where the first level is the "positive" case,
#' aka the event. All methods used here, "pROC", "auc_pairs", "ROCR", have been setup to expect this. This goes against
#' the default sertting for both "pROC" and "ROCR", which will not give an AUC less than .5 because they will reorder
#' levels. We don't want this because we believe you CAN make a classifier perform worse than chance (for research or
#' whatnot). It can be very confusing if levels are reordered automatically and different functions give you different
#' AUC. Also, AUC has been very popular, but I strongly recommend reporting Balanced Accuracy instead.
#' @param prob Float, Vector: Probabilities or model scores (e.g. c(.32, .75, .63), etc)
#' @param labels True labels of outcomes (e.g. c(0, 1, 1))
#' @param method String: "pROC", "auc_pairs", or "ROCR": Method to use. Will use `pROC::roc`, [auc_pairs],
#' `ROCR::performance`, respectively. They should all give the same result, they are included for peace of mind.
#' See Details
#' @param verbose Logical: If TRUE, print messages to output
#' @export
